Lives in a leaf module so deployment backends (which are imported
during ``aptl.core.lab`` module load) can reference these types
without importing the full ``aptl.core.lab`` module — that direction
created a circular import (``lab.py`` -> snapshot -> deployment
package -> backend.py / docker_compose.py -> ``aptl.core.lab``
mid-load).

``aptl.core.lab`` re-exports the public names for backward
compatibility, so callers that already import from ``aptl.core.lab``
keep working.
