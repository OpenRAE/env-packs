"""Backend-observed service health for realized scenario nodes (issue #578).

``docker compose up -d`` returns as soon as the daemon has *created* the
containers. It says nothing about whether the declared services actually came
up, so treating its exit code as "the scenario is realized" is the vacuous
realization ADR-046's runtime addendum forbids: a resource counts as realized
only once the backend has started it *and* observed it.

Health here is observed, never declared. RAES 2 removed
``runtime.health`` from the authored SDL contract (ACES #761) precisely because
observed health is evidence, not an author declaration — so there is no declared
status to compare against and nothing to fabricate one from. The container
carries its own expectation instead: it reports a health state only when its
image or Compose service defines a healthcheck, so a non-empty health state is
that check's own claim and must reach ``healthy``. A container with no
healthcheck reports nothing and only has to be running.
