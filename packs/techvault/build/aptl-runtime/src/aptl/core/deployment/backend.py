"""Deployment backend protocol.

Defines the abstract interface for lab deployment backends. Each backend
implements lifecycle operations (start, stop, status, kill, pull) and
container interaction (list, logs, shell, exec, inspect) for a specific
deployment target (Docker Compose, SSH remote, Kubernetes, etc.).

Container interaction methods were added under CLI-004 (see ADR-023);
this lets local and SSH backends present a uniform surface so the same
CLI commands and core helpers (snapshot, flags, collectors) work without
caring whether the daemon is local or remote.

Follows the same Protocol pattern as RunStorageBackend in runstore.py.
