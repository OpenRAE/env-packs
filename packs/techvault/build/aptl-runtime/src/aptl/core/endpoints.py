"""Snapshot endpoint registry (ADR-036).

A small annotation table that maps a known container name to the
display metadata, container-side target port, and (for SSH) user that
``RangeSnapshot.services`` and ``RangeSnapshot.ssh`` need. The registry
does NOT carry host-published port numbers — those live in
``docker-compose.yml`` and reach snapshot capture through
``ContainerSnapshot.ports`` (populated by
``DeploymentBackend.host_list_lab_containers`` per ADR-023). This module
exists so adding a new endpoint is a single registry edit instead of
three places (``snapshot.py``, ``docker-compose.yml``, downstream
consumers).

Per ADR-036:

- Host-published port comes from runtime inventory, not the registry.
- A registered container whose runtime ports don't expose the expected
  target port + protocol → endpoint is omitted (treated as unavailable,
  not raised as a validation exception that would fail the whole
  snapshot).
- ``RangeSnapshot.to_dict()`` remains the redaction boundary. The
  registry carries no credential material at all: ``ServiceEndpoint``
  still has a ``credentials`` field for backward on-the-wire shape,
  but its value is the dataclass default empty string and ADR-029's
  redactor masks it regardless. Credential ownership is out of scope
  per ADR-036 Non-Goals.

    """Stable lab-topology annotation for a single container endpoint.

    Two protocol-shaped fields are kept disjoint because they answer
    different questions:

    - ``url_scheme`` — the application-layer scheme baked into the
      service URL the user sees (``https``, ``http``, ``ssh``). Only
      required for ``kind="service"``; SSH endpoints render their own
      ``ssh -i ... user@host -p port`` command and do not surface a URL.
    - ``transport_protocol`` — the OSI-L4 transport that
      ``parse_host_port`` must match against the Docker port string
      (``tcp`` or ``udp``). Required for both kinds; defaults to ``tcp``
      because every endpoint shipped today is TCP, but a future UDP/SCTP
      endpoint sets it explicitly.

    Conflating the two would let an entry quietly resolve through the
    parser's TCP default while claiming an HTTPS URL — exactly the
    "target port + transport protocol" boundary ADR-036 names.

    ``ssh_user`` is required for ``kind="ssh"`` and unused for services.

    No ``credentials`` field. ``ServiceEndpoint.credentials`` is the
    on-the-wire shape, and ADR-029 redacts it at
    ``RangeSnapshot.to_dict()`` (the field-name redactor in
    ``aptl.utils.redaction`` matches ``credentials`` as sensitive). A
    literal value in the registry would be source-side dead data —
    masked at every serialization boundary — so the registry carries
    no credential material at all. Credential ownership and surfacing
    are out of scope per ADR-036 Non-Goals.
