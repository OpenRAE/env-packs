"""Node-readiness / health-conformance comparison for the live validation gate.

Extracted from ``_live_gate_probes`` (SCN-010F / #323) to keep both modules
under the file-size budget. These helpers compare the realized ACES node
surface against the booted range's container snapshot: every realized node in a
started profile must map to a live container, and any container carrying a
healthcheck must actually report healthy.
``_live_gate_checks.check_defensive_stack_readiness`` imports
``_node_readiness_diagnostics`` and ``_warn_unhealthy_infra`` from here.
