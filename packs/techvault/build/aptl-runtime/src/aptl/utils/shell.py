"""Cross-platform execution of the lab's POSIX shell scripts.

A couple of control-plane steps (MCP build, SOC seed) are bash scripts. On
Linux and macOS they run directly via their shebang. Windows has no POSIX shell
on PATH by default, so this locates **Git Bash** — the shell shipped with Git
for Windows, a native Windows program (MSYS2) — and runs the script through it.

WSL's ``C:\\Windows\\System32\\bash.exe`` is deliberately *not* used: it runs the
script inside a separate Linux distribution with its own filesystem and
toolchain (and often no Docker CLI), which is not the intended runtime. We only
accept a Git-for-Windows bash.
