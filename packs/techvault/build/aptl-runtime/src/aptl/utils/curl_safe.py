"""Secret-safe curl JSON wrapper.

Single shared helper used by every component that talks to a SOC tool's
REST API via curl-subprocess (collectors, the MISP→Suricata sync service,
future services). Centralising it keeps timeout/TLS/error handling
uniform and prevents per-component drift in how secrets are passed to
curl.

Secret-safety:
  * The ``Authorization: <token>`` header — when provided via
    ``auth_header`` — is written to a 0600 temp file and passed to curl
    via ``-H @file`` rather than placed in argv. ``ps`` and
    ``/proc/<pid>/cmdline`` therefore cannot recover the token.
  * Basic auth has no argv path here: build the header value with
    :func:`basic_auth_header` and pass it as ``auth_header`` so the
    credentials travel through the same 0600 temp file (ADR-029), never
    ``-u user:pass`` in argv.
  * The request body, when provided, is written to a second 0600 temp
    file and passed via ``-d @file`` so any payload secret stays out of
    argv.

Failure handling: every error path returns ``None`` and never raises,
matching the fault-tolerant collector pattern.

TLS posture (priority order):
  1. ``insecure=True`` → ``curl -k`` (skip verification entirely).
  2. ``insecure=False`` and ``ca_cert_path`` set → ``curl --cacert <path>``.
  3. ``insecure=False`` and no path → curl's system trust store.
