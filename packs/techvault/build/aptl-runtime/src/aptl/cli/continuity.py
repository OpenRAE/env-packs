"""CLI implementation of ``aptl lab continuity-audit`` (issue #252).

Lives in its own module so :mod:`aptl.cli.lab` stays focused on the
lab-lifecycle commands (``start``/``stop``/``status``); the lab module
imports :func:`continuity_audit` and registers it as a subcommand of
``aptl lab``. See ADR-024 for the design and ADR-021 for the in-band
counterpart.

    Resolution order:

         match a safe character class and reference an existing run
         (the run directory and its ``manifest.json`` must already be

         orphan archive that ``aptl runs list`` cannot find).
      2. The active scenario session's ``run_id`` (when populated). A
         corrupt ``.aptl/session.json`` is non-fatal here — the audit
         should still repair iptables even if archive discovery fails.
         The session-derived id passes through the same shape +
         existence validation as the explicit override; if it fails,
         the audit degrades to "no archive" with a warning rather than
         failing loudly (the firewall repair is more important than
         archive discovery).

    in production flows; the session-bound archival path lights up
    once #263/RTE-001 wires the runtime engine. Until then, the
