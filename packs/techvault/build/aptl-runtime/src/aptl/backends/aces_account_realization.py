"""Resolve ACES account-placement payloads into typed realization records.

An `account-placement` resource lowers into a typed
:class:`DeploymentAccountRealization` here, or fails closed with an error
diagnostic when its target node has no registered account provider. This is the
interpret-time half of account realization: #577 (ADR-046 Account and Identity
Realization Addendum) makes the record load-bearing — the deployment backend's
``realize_accounts`` operation ensures the declared groups, users, memberships,
and non-secret attributes on the resolved target and verifies them by
read-after-write. The record carries non-secret identity only; the concrete
credential is generated inside the target/provider boundary and never crosses
this record (ADR-029). The set of services that have an account provider is
owned by a single code-owned binding (:mod:`aptl.core.deployment._account_provider`),
so this gate and the materializer never diverge.
