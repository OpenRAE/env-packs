"""Backend-observed realization state for the SEM-218 runtime gate (issue #578).

The SEM-218 non-approximation gate compares the value an author *declared* for a
realization concern against the value the backend *realized*, reading the latter
out of the snapshot the backend returns. APTL used to build that snapshot by
copying each planned resource's payload verbatim and marking it ``ready``, which
made the gate compare the plan against itself: it could never reject anything,
and a node the backend silently failed to start was still reported realized.

This module supplies the other half — what the deployment backend can actually
be *seen* to have done — so the snapshot records reality:

* a **node** is realized when its container is running (its ``os_family`` is read
  from the container's platform, so a linux-declared node backed by a windows
  container is caught);
* a **switch** node compiles to a network resource and is realized when the
  network exists;
* a resource the backend did not realize gets **no snapshot entry at all**, which
  is what the gate needs: an EXACT concern whose value is absent from the
  returned snapshot is a silent approximation and is rejected. Absence is the
  finding, not a gap to paper over.

The concern registry is imported from ACES rather than restated, so APTL cannot
drift from the set of concerns the gate actually enforces.
