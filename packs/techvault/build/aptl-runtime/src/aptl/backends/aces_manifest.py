"""APTL ACES backend manifest.

APTL publishes its runtime-target capability declaration as the canonical ACES
``backend-manifest-v2`` surface (``raes_backend_protocols.capabilities``), not an
APTL-local approximation. The manifest is what the ACES planner's
realization-support gate and ``aces conformance backend --profile
full-remote-control-plane`` validate against, so it must declare APTL's real
provisioning, orchestration, evaluation, and participant-runtime capability
against the published controlled vocabularies and contract authority — anything
less is rejected by the conformance corpus.

APTL is a full remote-control-plane backend: it realizes ACES provisioning plans
into Docker Compose profiles, exposes its scenario runtime engine (RTE-001)
workflow drive surface through the portable ``workflow-result-envelope-v1`` and
``workflow-history-event-stream-v1`` contracts (see
``aptl.backends.aces_orchestrator.AptlOrchestrator``), publishes objective and
condition evaluation through ``evaluation-result-envelope-v1`` and
``evaluation-history-event-stream-v1`` (see
``aptl.backends.aces_evaluator.AptlEvaluator``), and exposes a narrow red
participant runtime through the participant episode and behavior-history
contracts. It does not declare the deprecated SDL scoring chain
(``metrics``/``evaluations``/``tlos``/``goals``) as an APTL runtime capability.
