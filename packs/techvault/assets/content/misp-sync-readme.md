# APTL—Advanced Purple Team Lab

**Purple-team lab where AI agents drive the red and blue sides against an enterprise target stack.**

One `aptl lab start` brings up: a fictional company's infrastructure (AD, web, DB, file share, and DNS), a Kali red-team box, a SOC stack (Wazuh + Suricata + MISP + TheHive + Cortex + Shuffle), and MCP servers giving AI agents programmatic control over it. Scenarios are [Reproducible Agentic Environments SDL](docs/sdl/index.md) documents, selectable at startup; the Compose topology is realized from the nodes the scenario declares rather than a fixed preset, and each run captures a telemetry archive. Mail and reverse-engineering services are optional profiles and are not part of the default `techvault-operational` scenario.

**Use cases:** autonomous cyber-operations research, purple-team training, AI threat-actor assessment.

## Status

**🚧 Active development. Not for production. Not hardened.** This lab gives AI agents access to real penetration-testing tools and runs intentionally vulnerable services. Container escapes and other security issues are possible—keep it on a host you can rebuild and a network you control. Always monitor red-team agents during scenarios.

## Quick Start

Install the released CLI and materialize a lab, no clone required:

```bash
pipx install aptl-labs          # the released CLI, isolated in its own environment
aptl lab init my-lab            # materialize the lab assets into ./my-lab
cd my-lab
aptl lab start
```

`aptl lab init <dir>` copies the bundled lab assets (the Compose topology,
scenarios, config templates, and container build contexts) out of the
installed package into `<dir>`, which becomes your lab project directory. The
published wheel ships those assets, so a PyPI install alone can run a lab.
[pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/) installs the CLI into its own virtualenv, so the
system-`pip` block on modern Debian/Ubuntu/WSL2 hosts
([PEP 668](https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/)) never applies. Install pipx with
`sudo apt install pipx` if you do not have it.

To run from source instead (for development), clone the repo and use a
virtualenv editable install (the `python3 -m venv` step needs `python3-venv` on
Debian/Ubuntu). The checkout is itself the project directory, so no `lab init`
is needed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Brad-Edwards/aptl.git
cd aptl
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
aptl lab start
```

`aptl lab start` creates `.env` automatically when it is missing and replaces
template placeholder values with lab credentials that match the running
containers. The startup output points to `.env` for passwords and tokens. Run
`aptl lab info` later to reprint the same access summary.

By default it boots the full `techvault-operational` scenario. List the catalog
and start a smaller curated topology with:

```bash
aptl lab scenarios                                   # list startup scenarios
aptl lab start --scenario techvault-attacker-target  # or --scenario-path <file>
```

See [Scenarios](#scenarios) for the catalog.

Once it's up:

| Surface | URL / command |
|---|---|
| Wazuh Dashboard | <https://localhost:443> (`admin` / your `INDEXER_PASSWORD` from `.env`) |
| Victim shell | `aptl container shell aptl-victim` |
| Kali shell | `aptl container shell aptl-kali` |

Lifecycle:

```bash
aptl lab status   # running containers
aptl lab info     # URLs, usernames, and .env credential references
aptl lab stop     # graceful stop
aptl lab stop -v  # ⚠ destroys all lab data (Wazuh indexes, MISP, TheHive, configs)
aptl kill         # emergency: kill MCP server processes
aptl kill -c      # emergency: kill MCP processes AND all lab containers
```

## Requirements

- Docker + Docker Compose + Docker Buildx
- Python 3.11+
- RAM: 8 GB runs the smaller curated scenarios; the full `techvault-operational` stack needs more than 20 GB
- 20 GB+ disk
- Linux, macOS, or Windows with Docker Desktop/WSL2
- Open ports: 443, 8443, 9000, 9001, 9200, 55000 (and the rest of the published ports in `docker-compose.yml`)

The scenario environment is whatever the SDL scenario defines. The default `techvault-operational` topology (AD, web, DB, file share, DNS, mail, victims) is one shape, and [other scenarios](#scenarios) compose different ones. Component-by-component breakdown: [docs/architecture/index.md](docs/architecture/index.md).

## Scenarios

Scenarios are [Reproducible Agentic Environments SDL](docs/sdl/index.md) documents under `scenarios/`. `aptl lab scenarios` lists the catalog; `aptl lab start --scenario <id>` (or `--scenario-path <file>`) selects one. The Compose profiles that come up are **realized from the nodes the SDL declares**—the topology follows the scenario's content, including dependency closure, rather than a preset keyed off its name.

The catalog ships the operational default plus four curated slices:

| Scenario id | Boots | Omits |
|---|---|---|
| `techvault-operational` | TechVault enterprise, Kali, SOC, and observability (default) | Mail and reverse engineering |
| `techvault-attacker-target` | Kali + one monitored victim + Wazuh core + observability | Enterprise web tier, wider SOC stack |
| `techvault-enterprise-web` | Vulnerable webapp + DB + AD + Wazuh core + observability | Red-team apparatus, wider SOC stack |
| `techvault-defensive-min` | Wazuh manager / indexer / dashboard + observability | Attacker and enterprise components, wider SOC stack |
| `techvault-observability-core` | OTEL collector + Tempo + Grafana | Everything else—the smallest bounded surface |

Authoring and selection details: [SDL Reference](docs/sdl/index.md) · [Curated TechVault Variants](docs/sdl/techvault-curated-variants.md).

## AI Agents (MCP)

`aptl lab start` builds the seven MCP servers for the default scenario and
creates a private `.mcp.json` client configuration with the generated lab
credentials. Start your AI client from the project directory so its relative
entry points resolve correctly.

To rebuild the MCP artifacts without restarting the lab:

```bash
./mcp/build-all-mcps.sh
```

The repository still builds the optional reverse MCP artifact, but the
generated default client config omits it because the default SDL has no
reverse node. Full setup: [MCP Integration](docs/components/mcp-integration.md).

Smoke-test the wiring once the lab is up:

- Red side: ask the agent *"Use kali_info to show me the lab network"*
- Blue side: ask the agent *"Use wazuh_query_alerts to show me recent alerts"*

## Optional: Web UI

Localhost-only web UI for lab control and scenario runs.

```bash
pip install -e ".[web]"        # in the same .venv from Quick Start
aptl web serve                 # API server
cd web && npm install && npm run dev   # frontend (separate terminal)
```

Access at <http://localhost:5173> (dev) or <http://localhost:3000> (prod). The API container needs the host Docker socket; do not expose to untrusted networks.

## Ethics & Disclaimers

APTL uses commodity services and basic integrations. AI agents get Kali access—no enhancements to their latent capabilities beyond that. **No red-team enhancements will be added to this public repository.** An autonomous cyber-operations range is under development as a separate project.

You are responsible for following all applicable laws. The author takes no responsibility for your use of this lab. The repository contains intentional **test credentials** (covered by `.gitguardian.yaml`) for lab functionality—dummy values for educational use, not production secrets.
