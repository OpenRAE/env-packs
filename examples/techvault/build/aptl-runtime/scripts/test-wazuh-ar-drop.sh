# End-to-end validation that Wazuh active-response can drop kali->target
# packets when the agent runs in-process on the target (issue #248 AC#3).
#
# This script is the manual-runnable counterpart to
# tests/test_in_process_agents.py. It demonstrates the full prevention
# pipeline that ADR-019 + ADR-020 established:
#   eve.json / agent log -> Wazuh manager rule -> AR command ->
#   in-process agent -> iptables -I in target namespace -> drop.
#
# Procedure (against the webapp target — the most-attacked container):
#   1. Sanity check: lab is up, kali can reach webapp.
#   2. Append a temporary <active-response> block to the manager that
#      links a benign rule (HTTP 401 on webapp) to firewall-drop, with a
#      120s timeout so any leftover state auto-expires after the test.
#      Also append a temporary local rule that decodes a marker URL into
#      an alert at level >= 5 so the AR block actually fires.
#   3. Restart the manager so the new config is live.
#   4. From kali, hit the marker URL to trigger the rule.
#   5. Wait for AR to install the iptables drop in webapp.
#   6. Probe again from kali — must time out / fail.
#   7. Clean up the temporary rule + AR block, restart the manager, and
#      verify connectivity is restored.
#
# Idempotent (sentinel-tagged), safe to re-run after partial failure.
# Exit 0 = pass; non-zero = fail with a clear message.
