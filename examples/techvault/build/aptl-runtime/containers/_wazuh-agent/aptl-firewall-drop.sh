# APTL active-response: standalone iptables drop with kali whitelist
# (issue #249, ADR-021).
#
# This is a self-contained replacement for Wazuh's upstream
# `firewall-drop` script, NOT a wrapper. Forwarding stdin to a separate
# upstream process breaks Wazuh's stateful AR protocol — wazuh-execd
# can keep the channel open after the initial JSON to support a
# `check_keys` handshake, and a forwarding wrapper that buffers stdin
# would deadlock or break the dialogue. By implementing the iptables
# operation directly, the wrapper owns the stdin contract end-to-end.
#
# Wazuh sends one JSON object per invocation on stdin (stateless mode,
# Wazuh 4.x default for simple add/delete commands):
#
#     {"version":1,"command":"add","parameters":{"alert":{"data":{"srcip":"..."}}}}
#
# We read the first JSON object, extract `command` and
# `parameters.alert.data.srcip`, validate srcip as a literal IPv4
# (defends against decoder-injected newlines that would let an
# attacker spoof a whitelist hit), consult the flat-file whitelist at
# /var/ossec/etc/lists/active-response-whitelist, and either
# short-circuit (whitelisted on `add`) or run the iptables operation.
# `delete` (cleanup) ALWAYS runs, regardless of whitelist — drops
# installed before an IP joined the whitelist still get reaped on
# schedule.
#
# Override points (for tests): APTL_AR_WHITELIST, APTL_AR_LOG,
# APTL_AR_IPTABLES (path to the iptables binary; tests can point this
# at /bin/true to avoid mutating the lab's iptables).

# Validate SRCIP is a single dotted-decimal IPv4 with no control

# `grep -Fxq` treats multi-line input as multiple patterns and would
# short-circuit on the embedded whitelisted line. The regex permits
# only `<octet>.<octet>.<octet>.<octet>` with each octet 0-255.
