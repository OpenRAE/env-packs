"""Suricata named-volume seeding and source-ownership repair.

Split out of :mod:`aptl.core.credentials` (ADR-028/ADR-043): the credential
*rendering* path and the Suricata *seed* path share the same project-rooted
containment primitives but are otherwise independent concerns. Keeping them in
separate modules holds each below the file-length limit and lets the seed logic
evolve without touching the credential renderer.

Under ADR-043 the checked-in Suricata runtime inputs are copied into Compose
named volumes by a root seed container at lab start rather than rendered or
bind-mounted, so the upstream image entrypoint's ``chown`` can never rewrite
host-side ownership.
