"""Orchestrator-side purple-team continuity carve-out (issue #252).

Detects and reverts *blanket* kali source-IP DROP rules on target
containers. Complements ADR-021's in-band ``aptl-firewall-drop``
whitelist by catching out-of-band paths (custom AR scripts, raw
iptables in a Wazuh manager command field, etc.) that bypass the
wrapper.

The audit must preserve granular defensive actions: rules qualified by
port, protocol, payload, interface, or any other matcher are valid blue
tradecraft and stay. Only rules of the shape
``-A INPUT -s <kali_ip>[/32] -j DROP|REJECT`` — with no other matchers —
are reverted.

See ADR-024 for the full design and ADR-021 for the in-band counterpart.

        failure during reversion; each AUDIT_FAILED event is a backend
        failure during inspection. ``archive_error`` is non-None when
        ``run_store.append_jsonl`` raised — reversions are still
        applied to the live system but the archive write failed, and
        the caller must surface that to operators rather than report
        a successful archive.

            case with a clear error, but library callers must also be
            prevented from believing a clean-empty-events return means
            "no wedges found" when in fact the audit was protecting
            zero source IPs.
